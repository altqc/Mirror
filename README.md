# Mirror Client Base
clean open source 1.8.9 forge ghost client base  
free to use, sell, ect... (MIT Lisence)    
no support will be given with making modules, although feel free to dm me about base stuff @[iTrqPss#8258](http://discordapp.com/users/359833743906832385)
  
## Development Enviroment  
No support will be given with setting up your own dev env  
  
## Usage  
Anyone may use this base, but the documentation will be limited to basic module creation.  
This base is not meant for learning or for skids, this base is meant for semi-experienced to very-experienced module developers.  
Undetectability and self-destructing is not included, you must make your closet cheat act as one yourself.  
Also please keep in mind this is in no way intended to bypass screenshares, in fact, forge mods in general shouldnt be made to bypass screenshares.  
  
## Events
The current event system is very basic and is handled by forge events.  
The three current events are `PreMotion`, `PostMotion`, and `OnClick`  
    
## Features  
The finished Mirror project will include a module base, event base, commands, a few modules, a me.haruhime.gui and more.  
Many features will be able to be changed and customized in me.haruhime.Mirror  


## Customization  
Mirror is fully modular and you can change it however you like! .
Most cusomization options can even be fully disabled for a minimalist client.  
Things such as Discord RPC have several presets but you can also always make your own.

## Dependancies  
While you may edit the build.gradle, the one provided has needed dependancies hosted by [@josephworks](https://github.com/josephworks)  
A list of dependancies will be present later on.  

## Authentication Utils   
The project will include authentication utils but not methods to use them, you must write these yourself.  
The provided utils are basic HWID to MD5 hash getters.  
A basic concept guide written by me may be viewed [here](https://gist.github.com/Trapss/962c3989d362d07a2cefc57de128ac04).  
  
## Contributing  
All code is either written by me, or if stated otherwise taken from open source projects.  
If looking to contribute to this project dm me @[iTrqPss#8258](http://discordapp.com/users/359833743906832385)  
If you do not dm me first, I will deny all forks.  
There will not be a Discord server made for this as it is not only unnecessary but also I rather not put any of my accounts at risk of termination.
  
## Bugs  
There is bound to be bugs in this base, if you notice one open an issue.  
Some bugs I simply can not fix, these can be left to other contributers and client developers.  
You can also report buts by dming me @[iTrqPss#8258](http://discordapp.com/users/359833743906832385)
